Privacy Policy

The YaShlang project aims to provide a private, anonymous experience
for using media web services. The app does not collect any data, does
not require login and does not identify its users in any way.

However, media streams, shown in the app, are taken from 3-pty services
(such as YouTube), so, while loading content, the app would request data
from 3-pty services on your behalf. While such requests are fully anonymous,
you should concider getting acquanted with privacy policies of those 3-pty
services (such as YouTube).
