-- Download streams for fave videos, switch offline mode on and use the app without internet even when youtube would get broken.
-- Video thumbs also won't get downloaded online in offline mode, cached thumbs would be shown. To make sure all thumbs for all offline videos are cached, switch thumb caching on, switch offline mode off, go to Config > menu > ðŸ’¾ Stream downloads > Downloaded and scroll the list, so all icons would be cached. Then switch offline mode on, all offline videos should be shown with cached thumbs.
